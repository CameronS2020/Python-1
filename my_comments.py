tank_size = 15 # This means gas tank size, not tank like army tank. (I was confused for a bit)

distance = 600 # Total distance the car can travel before running out of gas. 

mpg = distance / tank_size # This formula works because if 15 gallons maxes out at 600 distance traveled, each gallon is used 15 times, leading to 600/15 for a single gallon
# ToDo: simplify what I said above.
print("Miles per gallon:", mpg) # The print function works :>
